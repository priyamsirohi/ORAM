\title{ConcurORAM: Multi-client concurrency for tree-based oblivious RAM}
\begin{document}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
 Oblivious RAM (ORAM) technology has advanced rapidly in recent years as 
 an increasing amount of data is outsourced to remote storage. Although 
 tree based ORAMs such as PathORAM and RingORAM have achieved nearly-optimal 
 bandwidth blowup for {\em single client} scenarios, the low overall 
 throughput due to high latency of access 
 makes them prohibitive in multi-client scenarios.
 
 In this paper, we propose a multi-client concurrent variant 
 of RingORAM that reduces waiting for concurrent client accesses and 
 increases overall throughput by a factor of the number of clients.
