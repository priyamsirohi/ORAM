\section{Model}
\label{model}

{\bf Deployment.~} \sysname~ considers a deployment model with two parties: the ORAM clients (with limited 
local storage) and the ORAM server (a remote storage that hosts the clients' data).
The server stores data in terms of fixed sized``blocks''. \sysname~ considers $N$ 
blocks of outsourced data on the server. Clients can also access data in terms of 
blocks with each block being denoted by a logical block ID denoted by $id$. 


The parties engage in an interactive query-response based protocol established 
by \sysoram~. 

Further, Clients access data in terms of fixed size blocks 
as stored on the server. 

{\bf Clients.~} Clients are considered honest in the \sysoram~ model and 
do not interact with each other. Further, the clients share the key to the ORAMs and 
the secret hash functions used for PD-ORAM, which are stored encrypted on the server.
Clients engage the server using different read and write 

{\bf Server.~} \sysname~ considers an untrusted server that is honest but curious.
The server follows the \sysname~ protocol and
