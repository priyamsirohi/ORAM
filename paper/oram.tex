\title{ConcurORAM: Multi-client concurrency for RingORAM}
\begin{document}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
 Oblivious RAM (ORAM) technology has advanced rapidly in recent years as 
 an increasing amount of data is outsourced to remote storage. Although 
 tree based ORAMs such as PathORAM and RingORAM have achieved nearly-optimal 
 bandwidth blowup for {\em single client} scenarios, the low overall 
 throughput due to high latency of access 
 makes them prohibitive in multi-client scenarios.
 
 In this paper, we propose ConcurORAM, a multi-client concurrent variant 
 of RingORAM that reduces waiting for concurrent client accesses and 
 increases overall throughput by a factor of the number of clients.
 Our concurrency mechanism is based on the concurrency mechanism 
 proposed in \cite{privatefs}. 
 
 We leverage the asynchronous nature of RingORAM queries to 
 support concurrent client accesses up-to an eviction. Further, we 
 use a pyramid ORAM using the PD-ORAM abstraction detailed in \cite{privatefs} 
 for concurrent accesses to the position map.
