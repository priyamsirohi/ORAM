\title{Towards practical}
\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}
 Data storage in remote servers has become popular in recent years with an increasing 
 number of enterprises using services such as Amazon EC2 and github for storing 
 valuable (and potentially private) data. Privacy of this data is 
 essential. One such tool for ensuring complete privacy of server-hosted data is by deploying 
 an Oblivious RAM (ORAM) for accessing data. An ORAM effectively ``hides'' the data 
 access patterns of a user by making all access patterns computationally indistinguishable.
 
 ORAM technology has advanced rapidly in recent years \cite{privatefs,binarytreeoram,pathoram,ringoram} with 
 PathORAM \cite{pathoram} achieving the near-optimal bandwidth lower bound established in \cite{goldreich}. 
 Inspite of these promising developments, ORAMs are yet to become feasible for deployment on commercial clouds. 
 
 In this paper, we attempt to make PathORAM \cite{pathoram} more practical by reducing the average latency of 
 concurrent client queries. This is achieved by using multiple parallel threads for 
 fetching and eviction of data. We implement a protoype of our system and show an
 improvement in query response time proportional to the number of concurrent threads.
