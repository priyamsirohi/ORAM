\title{ConcurORAM: Multi-client concurrency for RingORAM}
\begin{document}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
 Oblivious RAM (ORAM) technology has advanced rapidly in recent years as 
 an increasing amount of data is outsourced to remote storage. Although 
 tree based ORAMs such as PathORAM \cite{pathoram} and RingORAM \cite{ringoram} 
 have achieved near-optimal 
 bandwidth blowup for {\em single client} scenarios, their low overall 
 throughput due to high latency of access 
 makes them prohibitive in multi-client scenarios. 
 
  In this paper, we propose ConcurORAM, a multi-client concurrent variant 
 of RingORAM that reduces waiting for concurrent client accesses and 
 increases overall throughput. ConcurORAM leverages the asynchronous nature of RingORAM queries to 
 support concurrent client accesses until the next round of eviction. Further to 
 support concurrent accesses, the position map for RingORAM is stored in a pyramid ORAM 
 using the PD-ORAM deamortization abstraction detailed in \cite{privatefs}. 
 
 ConcurORAM has been implemented and tested. It shows an overall increase 
 in throughput by a factor of \todo{to be filled} and a reduction in query execution time by a factor of \todo {to be filled} 
 over a standard implementation 
 of RingORAM for a multi-client scenario.
